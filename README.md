# Pilot-Recruitment-App
This is my Industrial project which was created under Air India Ltd. Its an Android Application which allows Trainee pilots
to register themselves by providing their details and based on that the app decides their elligiblity status i.e whether they are elligible to register or not. The app also allows the users to check their status via their email id provided at the time of registration and a 4 digit user id generated at the time of submission. The details are stored in a MYSQl server and the networking aspect is handled with the help of Volley Library and PHP.
